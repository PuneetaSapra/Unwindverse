                <p class="par">Often people get confused about their thoughts and feelings. Due <br>to this, they fail to decide what should they do about it.<br>
                    In this project, we will help people by giving clarity about their mood.<br> After this, we will suggest them some interactive activities according to their <br>current mood by using machine learning approaches <br>that will help them to get a better understanding of <br>their mental health which will further help them to do correct activities accordingly.<br>
